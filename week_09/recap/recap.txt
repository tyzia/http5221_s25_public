Recap from Week 8
(delivered at Week 9)


The goal of accessibility is
to make content available for
all users.

Correct heading structure makes
html document semantically correct.

<h1>
The main heading of the page.
Should be always present.
Should be only one per page.

<h2>
Header for top-level sections of
the page.

<h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>
Headers for nested sections.

You should avoid skipping header levels.

Bad:

H1 - H3 - H4
H1 - H1 - H3 - H4
H1 - H2 - H3 - H1
H2 - H3 - H4

Good:

H1 - H2 - H3 - H4

Visual design of your headings
may not match their semantic meaning.

Don't use h1 only because you need
a heading with large text. Use
appropriate header (h2, h3, etc)
and apply CSS styles to it to make
it larger.


Semantics

HTML elements that convey meaning
about the content they enclose.

Benefits of semantic elements:

- Improve accessibility for screen readers.
- Improve SEO.
- Enhance code readability.

Example of non-semantic element:

<div> This is navigation of my website </div>

Correct semantic element:

<nav> This is navigation of my website </nav>



<section>

Defines a section on a page.
Typically, has a heading and content.

<section>
    <h1>Lorem ipsum</h1>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</p>
</section>


<article>

Specifies independent content.

<article>
    <h2>Google Chrome</h2>
    <p>Google Chrome is a web browser</p>
</article>


<main>

Defines main content of the page.
The content inside should be unique.
Doesn't include: sidebars, nav, footer.

<nav> links </nav>
<main>
  <h1>Most Popular Browsers</h1>
  <p>Chrome, Firefox, and Edge are the most used browsers today.</p>
  <article> ... </article>
  <article> ... </article>
</main>
<footer> Copyright </footer>


<header>

Represents intro content and title.

<article>
  <header>
    <h1>What Do You Do?</h1>
    <p>My mission:</p>
  </header>
  <p>My mission is to stop the degradation.</p>
</article>


<footer>

Defines footer for the page or section.
Typically, has author info, copyright, contact.

<footer>
  <p>Author: Andrei Navumau</p>
  <p><a href="mailto:andrei.navumau@humber.ca">email me</a></p>
</footer>



<nav>

Defines set of navigation links.

<nav>
  <a href="/html/">HTML</a>
  <a href="/css/">CSS</a>
</nav>


<img>

This tag is not semantic.
We need always to add 'alt' attribute
to make it semantic and correct HTML

Best practice creating a good alt text:

1) Be descriptive but concise.

Bad alt:
"A close-up image of a fresh red apple
sitting on a pristine white ceramic plate,
slightly tilted, with a glossy surface
that reflects light"

Good alt:
"Red apple on a white plate"

2) Avoid Redundancy.

HTML
<h2>Sales Decrease in 2024</h2>
<img src="2.png">

Bad alt:

"A bar chart showing sales decrease
over the past year for the year 2024"

Good alt:
"Bar chart showing sales decrease
over the past year"

3) Don't use 'picture' or 'image'.

Bad alt:
"Image of a sunset over the ocean"

Good alt:
"Sunset over the ocean"

4) Take context into account.

Bad alt:
"Logo"

Good alt:
"Company logo, link to homepage"

5) Summarize key message for complex images.

Bad alt:
"Pie chart"

Good alt:
"Pie chart showing market share:
30% for North America, 20% for Europe,
25% for Asia"

6) Consider the userâ€™s perspective.

Bad alt:
"Two people shaking hands"

Good alt:
"Two colleagues shaking hands in
a professional setting"

Empty alt text

For purely decorative images
alt text may be empty, though
'alt' attribute should still be present.
